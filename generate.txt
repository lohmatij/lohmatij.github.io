I am a Los Angeles based cinematographer with considerable camera department work experience. I started as a set electrician more than ten years ago. My primary education is a MFA in Cinematography from Saint Petersburg State University of Cinema and Television. At the current time, I am enrolled in various UCLA Extension courses for further training. Most of my camera operator and assistant camera experience is from feature projects. As a cinematographer, I have worked as a Director of Photography on several short films.
